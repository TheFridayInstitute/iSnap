UI:
* Look through JS errors from prod
* Issues from GitHub

Algorithmic:
* [This doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_t-jeOH34-yaK4aXZpbNDNnAvZt5m4d-1ZY2gTcSQ6o/edit)

Stretch:
* Merge in Berkeley
* Open custom block editor automatically when refreshing/viewing logs
* Have custom blocks in BlockHints show up as they do on screen (since you actually know the spec for those)

From logging:
* loading projects: update projectID quicker
* possible duplicate projectIDs?
* log sprite movements in the stage
* issues in tracker
