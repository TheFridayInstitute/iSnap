* Look through JS errors from prod
* Issues from GitHub
* Refresh Script bounds when hints are displayed
* Right clicking on some input types inside hints causes errors (NBD)
* Thumbsed down hints should not reshow

Algorithmic:
* [This doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_t-jeOH34-yaK4aXZpbNDNnAvZt5m4d-1ZY2gTcSQ6o/edit)

Stretch:
* Merge in Berkeley
* Open custom block editor automatically when refreshing/viewing logs
* Have custom blocks in BlockHints show up as they do on screen (since you actually know the spec for those)
