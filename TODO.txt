* Look through JS errors from prod
* Issues from GitHub 
* Merge in Berkeley?
* No ratings for non-suggestion popups
* Refresh Script bounds when hints are displayed
* Right clicking on some input types inside hints causes errors (NBD)

Stretch:
* Open custom block editor automatically when refreshing/viewing logs
* Have custom blocks in BlockHints show up as they do on screen (since you actually know the spec for those)
