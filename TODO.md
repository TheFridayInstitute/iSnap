Highlight:
* Bugs:
  * Duplicating a single block with a full-script highlight has a graphical bug
* TODO:
  * Test on existing hint requests
  * Show that you need more custom block inputs (possibly in calls as well)
  * Save preferences
  * Logging
  * Something should show up for hidden custom block hints
  * Add versioning to JS files to prevent caching issues
* Reach:
  * Show list insert hints as a dialog
  * Find a better way of doing structure hints
  * Make a more uniform way of logging node IDs

UI:
* Fix parent.adjustBounds bug in HintBar
* Clean up breaks the hint margin for custom blocks

Continuing:
* Look through JS errors from prod
* Issues from GitHub

Stretch:
* Merge in Berkeley
* Have custom blocks in BlockHints show up as they do on screen (since you
actually know the spec for those)
* Log sprite movements in the stage
