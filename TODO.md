Bugs:
* A LinkHint to an empty custom block will look odd

UI:
* Fix parent.adjustBounds bug in HintBar
* Make assignment selection prettier
* "Not enough"/"Too much" -> "You should have N"
* Custom block hints should include the header block

Algorithmic:
* GG1 bad first hints?
* [This doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_t-jeOH34-yaK4aXZpbNDNnAvZt5m4d-1ZY2gTcSQ6o/edit)

Continuing:
* Look through JS errors from prod
* Issues from GitHub

Stretch:
* Merge in Berkeley
* Open custom block editor automatically when refreshing/viewing logs
* Have custom blocks in BlockHints show up as they do on screen (since you actually know the spec for those)

From logging:
* loading projects: update projectID quicker
* possible duplicate projectIDs?
* log sprite movements in the stage
